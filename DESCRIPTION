Description: An R implementation to read/write between Simple Feature (`sf`) spatial objects to parquet files. Parquet files are an open-source, column-oriented data storage formate from Apache (https://parquet.apache.org/), now popular across programming languages. This implementation converts simple feature list geometries between binary formats for use by `arrow`, and CRS information is maintained in standard metadata formats.
